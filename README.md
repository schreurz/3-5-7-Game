# 3-5-7-Game

## How to Play
<ul>
  <li>The goal of this game is to make your opponent draw the final 'salt packet'.</li>
  <li>To start you choose one of the three rows.</li>
  <li>From the chosen row you may take as many packets as you would like.</li>
  <li>Your turn is over. Each player alternates choosing a row then taking salt packets until the game is over.</li>
</ul>

### HINT
If played correctly the player who goes first should win everytime. You get to go first so you have a chance, but if you mess up then gg ez.

## Python Program
This is the first project I created with Python. Created in 2014, this was the first project I did in Python.
The concept of this game was taken from a 'salt packet' strategy game my grandpa taught me. 

## APP
This is the implementation of my Python Program into an android app.
